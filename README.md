## Architecture

This project uses Riverpod for state management and Clean Architecture.

### Riverpod

We chose [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) as a solution for State Management.

Here is a diagram that shows how providers and states are organized in the project :

### Clean Architecture

We rely as much as possible on the Clean Architecture.
It is important to distinct the following layers in the code :

- Entities
- Database provider
- Repository
- Business logic
- UI
