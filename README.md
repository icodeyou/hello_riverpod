A complete starter project for Flutter apps.

With hello_riverpod, you can easily create a new Flutter project that follows the guidelines of Clean Architecture, and with all the basic packages ready to use (`riverpod`, `go_router`, `freezed`, `intl`, `mocktail`).

## Prerequisites

Installed version of [Mason](https://pub.dev/packages/mason)

Installed version of [Very Good CLI](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_cli)
✅ hello_riverpod tested with version 0.9.1

## Why are we using Very Good CLI ?

`Very Good Core` provides all the configuration we need for a new project with several flavors. This has become a standard for many developers, even for those using Riverpod. The problem is that 'very_good create' generates projects with an architecture based on BLoC.

Thanks to `hello_riverpod`, you now have a way to generate a 'Very Good project', and clean it in a way that makes it ready to use Riverpod instead of BLoC.

## Get Started

All you need is [this script](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/icodeyou/hello_riverpod/blob/master/gen.sh).
Download it and save it under the name `gen.sh` in a folder where you want to create your new projects.

Then, you just have to run :

```shell
./gen.sh
```

And follow the instructions.

Your projects will be added in a folder named `HELLOWORLDS/`

Feel free to create an issue if you have any question.

Cheers ✨
